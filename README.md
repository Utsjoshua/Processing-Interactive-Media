# Processing-Interactive-Media

This project was created using Processing during my university subjects. 
The project is a painting tool which you are able to customise the colour, shape and size of the brush.
You can also see an animation of your drawing that will spread across the screen and bounce around.
Depending on the colours that you use, when the moving particles bounce on the screen edge, it will make a piano sound.
You can change how it animates and whether to have sound on or muted.

Controls:
Draw with the left mouse button and drag around the canvas.
Press space to add 10 seconds to the timer.
Press backspace to remove 10 seconds from the timer.
Press enter to skip waiting the timer and continue to the next phase.
